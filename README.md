# Realism-enhancement
Contains python code to allow YAWVR motion chair and bHaptics haptic vest to work with your keyboard/mouse/joystick

Such devices like bHaptics and YawVR are made for VR almost exclusively, but with a bit of tweaking and lots of code you can easily alter them to enhance flatscreen gaming experience to something amazing!
The code provided was designed to be used in Star Citizen but can work for any game as it simple uses keyboard/mouse/joystick inputs.
The code can be compiles to an EXE and you can adjust any settings via a system tray icon.
